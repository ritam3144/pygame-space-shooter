# 🚀 Space Shooter Game – Built with GitHub Copilot

This is a simple **space shooter game built using Python and Pygame**, generated entirely using [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). I didn't write a single line of code manually — instead, I guided Copilot through natural language prompts to build and improve the game step by step.
